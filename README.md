# Andre Besner's Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This simple website was created to assist with studying.
Each step of the website building process was outlined with instructions to familiarize each student with the fundamentals of coding.
This solved the question 'What goes into making a website?'
I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

## Usage

In order to use website in it's current form. Download the code as a ZIP and extract with something like 7zip. Right click the html.index file and open it with your favourite web browser. Even better use visual studios extension live server.
From here you are presented with four topics; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. There will be a couple helpful notes under each section.
You can right click the page and inspect to see the HTML going on in background.
You can navigate to the console in order to see a randomly generated topic for you to begin studying that uses a simple javascript function. You will find the code for this in assets folder in scripts.js
